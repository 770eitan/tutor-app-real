### **Description**
This  adresses a problem that many tutors might face: keeping up with the status of assignments and current students. 

Tutor-app assists tutors in organizing their assignments and students. If she is logged in, a Tutor can add, edit, mark complete, and delete any of her  assignments. 
She can also add and delete the name, age, and favorite subject of students to her tutoring roster.

These features allow the tutor easy access to her assignments and roster, making for a more enjoyable tutor-tutoree experience.

**Future Feature Development**
- As a user, I should be able to make assignments for specific students so that I can make assignments based on each individual. 
- As a user, I should be able to mark an assignment as complete for each student so that I can see which students have turned in a particular assignment and who still needs to complete their assignments. 
- As a user, I should be able to view a student's information and, from that screen,  see which assignments have been completed and which haven't.
- As a user, I should be able to make comments on each assignment and student with the option of making that comment visible to other signed-in tutors and/or the public.
